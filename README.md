This is my Weather App i had build:
Technologies:
1. Node and Express JS, Axios: for server side rendering and fetching API, to catching the data from OpenWeatherApp
2. EJS: To templating my HTML and rendering data from api to my website.
This is just a simple project for my assignment about calling a public API, and using data from API provided to rendering back to my site.
